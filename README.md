# Solar panel fault detection

The presence of dust, snow, bird droppings, and other debris on the surface of solar panels can significantly reduce their efficiency and, consequently, the amount of energy they produce. Therefore, it is essential to regularly monitor and clean these panels to maintain optimal performance. Developing an effective procedure for monitoring and cleaning solar panels is crucial for enhancing module efficiency, lowering maintenance costs, and conserving resources.

The objective of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of various machine learning classifiers in accurately detecting the presence of dust, snow, bird droppings, and other physical and electrical issues on solar panel surfaces. By identifying the best-performing classifiers, we aim to implement a reliable and efficient monitoring system that maximizes energy production and minimizes maintenance efforts.
